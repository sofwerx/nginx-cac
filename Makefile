# See https://iase.disa.mil/pki-pke/getting_started/Pages/administrators.aspx for instructions
# on how to obtain DoD PKI certs -- which are *not* CAC-firewalled. The ZIP file they link you to
# includes the raw DoD Root certs in various formats. This Makefile just picks out the 3 current
# root certs and concatenates them into a single file. Worked for me as of 2018-06-09
#
# unzip -p is used to dump directly to stdout, tr -d converts text to Unix format

# ***NOTE*** the DISA IASE website appears to use http instead of https for the

# sure to manually turn it back into an HTTPS link.
